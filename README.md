# java-se-jpa-jta-jndi-log4jdbc

======
What to do, if you want to use JPA, but you don't have a Container or an Applikation Server :)
======

a small Java SE Applikation with 

* use of JPA 2.1 (Hibernate)
* Bitronix (Spring) JTA Transaction Management
* JNDI for lookup DataSource
* log4jdbc, if you want to "export" into a File: all the (full!) sql commands, the JPA used
